# Berlin TWC

This repository is responsible for most content visible on the website [TechWorkersBerlin.com](https://TechWorkersBerlin.com). The site is made with a static site generator called [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) in a language called Ruby.

## Getting Started

### With Docker (recommended)

We use Docker to have a reproducible development environment.
Before proceeding, install [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) on your system.

1. Start the application with the command: `docker-compose up`
2. Access the application in a browser at `localhost:4000`
3. Execute other commands in the Docker container: `docker-compose run --rm --service-ports jekyll bash`

### Without Docker

1. Install dependencies: `bundle install && npm install`
2. Start a local server: `npm start && bundle exec jekyll serve`
3. Verify all internal links are valid: `bundle exec rake`

Open a browser to localhost:4000

## Add an event

Add file inside the [`_events`](_events) directory. Copy a previous file as a template, and make sure to include the right time zone for Berlin!

## Translation

I18n (internationalization) is made available with the [jekyll-multiple-languages-plugin](https://github.com/kurtsson/jekyll-multiple-languages-plugin/). When a page has a translated version available, a link will show up on the top right if you use the [default_translate](_layouts/default_translate.html) layout. English is the default language, while other languages have their two letter ISO code prefixed, for example [TechWorkersCoalition.org/ru](https://TechWorkersCoalition.org/ru) for Russian.

### Adding new language
1. Add new language key to [en.yml](_i18n/en.yml)
2. Add two letter iso code in [config](_config.yml). The order here determines the order shown on the page. English must be first.
3. Inside the [i18n](_i18n) directory create a
  - `LANGUAGE/` directory (where LANGUAGE is two letter ISO code for that language)
  - `LANGUAGE.yml` with the language key and value in its own language, for example `es: Espa√±ol`

Note, only the default [en.yml](_i18n/en.yml) must contain the names of each language. The other language yaml files contain just their own language key.

## Adding Netlify Build Plugins

Netlify is both our server and continuous integration. It offers [plugins](https://docs.netlify.com/configure-builds/build-plugins/) which can be ran before deploying the site, to either perform some checks or optimizations. Check out our [netlify.toml], it has some build plugins installed. To test them locally on your own machine run:  
```
# Ensure that you have the netlify build command available
# (in future this will be provided via the CLI)
npm install @netlify/build -g

# In the project working directory, run the build as netlify would with the build bot
netlify-build
```
