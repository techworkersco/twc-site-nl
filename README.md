# TWC Site

This repository is responsible for most content visible on the website [TechWorkersCoalition.co](https://TechWorkersCoalition.co). The site is made with a static site generator called [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) in a language called ruby.

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies: `bundle install`
2. Start a local server: `bundle exec jekyll serve`
3. Verify all internal links are valid: `bundle exec rake`

Open a browser to localhost:8080

## Add your city

If your city's local is not mentioned in the website, link to it on the homepage [here](_layouts/home.html) and if you want a markdown page see the other examples [here](city_local)
