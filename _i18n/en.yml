  summary: "Tech Workers Coalition Netherlands is where tech workers come together to build collective power in our workplaces.<br><br>Are you a tech worker? If you work at a tech company, or in a tech-related role in any other type of organization, then yes: youâ€™re a tech worker! Tech workers could include, for example, people working as customer service agents, software developers, delivery riders, warehouse workers, content moderators, copywriters, engineers, video game artists, service and kitchen staff, system administrators, UI/UX designers, and more.What can tech workers achieve together? Quite a bit, if we organize and act strategically. Without tech workers, no tech.<br><br>Together, we are more powerful when we stick up for ourselves and support one another, for example to achieve higher wages, reduced work hours, protection of labour rights, healthier working conditions, dignity at work, and to fight against racism and discrimination.<br><br>Currently Tech Workers Coalition Netherlands is in the process of starting up and gathering issues. What would you like to change about your work? Do you have ideas and would you like to join forces? Weâ€™d love to hear from you.<br><br>Tech won't save us: organize! ðŸ¤—"
