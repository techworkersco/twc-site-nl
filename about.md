# About

It first began when a panel about _Tech Workers Movement_ was held on 10 June, 2019 at Aquarium Am SÃ¼dblock, featuring Logic Magazine co-founders [Ben Tarnoff](https://twitter.com/bentarnoff) and [Moira Weigel](https://twitter.com/moiragweigel).  Ben is a member of the Boston TWC chapter, and connected Berlin to the other chapters. You can watch the [video](https://www.facebook.com/halbzehn.fm/videos/423601581824448/) or listen for [audio](https://soundcloud.com/rosaluxstiftung/the-new-tech-worker-movement) of the panel. 10 days later we launched our first [public meeting](/events/1.md) on 20 June, 2019.
