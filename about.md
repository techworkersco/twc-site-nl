# Who We Are

The Tech Workers Coalition is a home for progressive tech workers in the Bay Area who want to get shit done. Weâ€™re a democratically structured, all-volunteer, and worker-led organization. Our active participants include workers in the tech industry, members from labor union locals, community organizers, and friends. At this point, membership consists of attending meetings in person and working on the various projects that people are interested in. We organize online but IRL is the crux of what we do.
