Simply put, techwerkers.nl is a collective of tech workers in The Netherlands. We (including you!) are a grassroots collective that builds collective power in your workplace. We support all workers in the tech industry -  broadly speaking this includes: engineers, delivery riders, content moderators, customer service, warehouse pickers, video game artists and more!

techwerkers.nl is a chapter of the broader [Tech Workers Coalition (TWC) NL](https://techworkerscoalition.org/).

As a collective, we aligned on our mission and our vision as to what we want to achieve.

**Our mission**

> We equip tech workers in the Netherlands with education, training, and community support, so they can organize their workplace and take back power.

**Our vision**

> Safe workplaces, great contracts, transparency and equality, a democratic industry.

There is an organizing meeting every 2 weeks where we brainstorm, plan activities, and discuss. Join one of our [upcoming events](/en/events).

There is no I, there is no we, there is only you and what you can do for you and your colleagues.
