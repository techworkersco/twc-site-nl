## What does Tech Workers Coalition do?

With the Tech Workers Coalition, you can find your community, grow your knowledge about tech and workers' rights, and build the skills to organize to take back worker power.

### Find your community

Tired of going at it alone? Same. You deserve a supportive community that has your back. Whether it's in the office or out on the street, whether to resist impossible performance targets or tech-fuelled genocide---only together with fellow workers can you make real change and win.

### Grow knowledge and skills

Things are changing ever-faster, especially with tech at work. You need to know  your rights, your options, and get support when things get tough. Tech workers coalition offers both background and hands-on resources for tech workers. Come join info sessions and trainings on topics that matter to you, and share your own knowledge with other tech workers.

_**Obligatory disclaimer:** Tech workers aren't lawyers. That said, some law-nerds in the coalition do like to stay up-to-date with current Dutch labour law (or know who to call when it's needed)._

### Organize your workplace

Do you know who's on your works council? Does your workplace even have a works council? (It's a legal requirement for any company in the Netherlands with over 50 people.) Tech Workers Coalition can help you get more done through your works council. Or you could start a [workers' (labour) council](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Workers'_council), if that's more your thing? Get together with other tech workers to organize for get the workplace changes you want.

## FAQ

### Am I a tech worker?

If you're reading this, then quite likely, yes! If you work at a tech company, or in some tech-related role, then you're a tech worker.

Are you operating a *digibord* in the classroom? Driving rides for Uber, or delivering meals with the Thuisbezorgd app? Serving coffees or cleaning spaces at the ASML offices? Doing web dev, software engineering, design, product, or IT support? Congrats, you're a tech worker.

Tech Workers Coalition doesn't care about your formal employment status. If you're currently unemployed and not in waged labour, you're still very much welcome to join.

### Are you a union?

No. You may have heard of big labour unions in the Netherlands, such as FNV or CNV. Maybe you're even a member? Fine. Tech Workers Coalition is *not* like that. It's not a union. Instead, it's a peer-to-peer network that consists entirely of tech workers who support each other directly in workplace organizing.
