Tech Workers Coalition Netherlands is a community of tech workers doing workplace organizing in order to take back worker power in The Netherlands. Founded in 2024, the group is a local chapter of [Tech Workers Coalition](https://techworkerscoalition.org/), which has been active since 2017. 

From engineers and delivery drivers to content moderators, customer service agents, warehouse pickers, and video game artists---anyone in a tech-adjacent role or workplace can join.

## What can you do with Tech Workers Coalition?

With Tech Workers Coalition, you can find your community, grow your knowledge about tech and workers' rights, and build the skills to organize and take back worker power.

### Community

Tired of going at it alone? Same. You deserve a supportive community that has your back. Whether it's in the office, the warehouse, or out on the street, only together with fellow workers can you make real change and win.

### Knowledge and skills

Things are changing ever-faster, especially in tech. What are your rights as a worker? Where can you get support? Tech Workers Coalition offers both core insights and hands-on resources for tech workers. Come join info sessions and trainings on topics that matter to you, and share your own knowledge with other tech workers.

_**Disclaimer:** Tech workers aren't lawyers. That said, some law-nerds in the coalition do like to stay up-to-date with current Dutch labour law (or know who to call when it's needed)._

### Worker power

Do you know who's on your works council? (Does your workplace even have a works council??) Tech Workers Coalition can help you get more done through your works council. Or you could start a [workers' (labour) council](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Workers'_council), if that's more your thing? Get together with other tech workers to organize and get the workplace changes you want.

## FAQ

### Am I a tech worker?

If you're reading this, then quite likely, yes! Anyone who works at a tech company, or in some tech-related role, is a tech worker.

Are you operating a *digibord* in the classroom? Driving rides for Uber, or delivering meals with the Thuisbezorgd app? Serving coffee or cleaning rooms at the ASML offices? Doing web dev, software engineering, design, product, or IT support? Congrats, you're a tech worker.

Tech Workers Coalition doesn't care about your formal employment status. If you're currently unemployed and not in waged labour, you're still very much welcome to join.

### Are you a union?

No. You may have heard of big labour unions in the Netherlands, such as FNV or CNV. Maybe you're even a member? Fine. Tech Workers Coalition is *not* like that. It's not a union. Instead, it's a peer-to-peer network that consists entirely of tech workers who support each other directly in winning the changes you want.
