Nothing changes at work until you make some noise. This confessional is for all the squeaky wheels who won't be silent in the face of an unjust tech industry. If your boss said something that made your head spin, submit your "squeak" and we'll post it anonymously on our Instagram page ([@techwerkers](https://instagram.com/techwerkers/)). Why scream into the void when you can share your story with other Tech Workers? 

# How it works

You submit a secret, we remove any public identifying information (PII) before we post submissions to Instagram. We will also rephrase whatever content you submit, so there is no way for harmful actors to trace the submission back to you.
