Have you ever wondered how capitalism influences technological developments? What is the meaning of digital colonialism? What is the role of workers in the modern tech industry, and how we can unite and fight for liberation in the digital age?

Join us on the 8th of April at 17:30 for an educational event ‘Shaping radical technologies’! We will highlight the problems of tech under capitalism from a marxist perspective and motivate each other to repurpose tech for revolutionary struggles! There'll be presentations from [Radical Data](radicaldata.org) and the Tech Workers Coalition! The presentations will further elaborate on the links between AI, the value and future of labour, and offer a critical yet proactive approach to embedding alternative values in technology.

After the presentations we will have a discussion part, where everybody is welcome to share their critiques, hopes, and ideas surrounding radical technologies. No background knowledge required!

All the field-specific concepts will be introduced in an accessible way.

Where? VU StudentenD0k, de Boelelaan 1105  
When? Tuesday 8th of April, 17:30-20:00

See you there!
