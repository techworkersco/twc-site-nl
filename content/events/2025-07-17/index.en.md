Tech workers aren't always working. Time off work is among the core achievements of today's labour rights!

Come and join for a chill afternoon and evening in the Oosterpark in Amsterdam. (Exact spot to be confirmed. Look out for Tech Workers flags.) 

Potluck style: Bring along a snack and something to drink if you can (but no worries if not!). There'll likely be stickers, games, some zines, nice people to hang out with, maybe some music?

Feel free to bring a coworker, friend, pet or partner. Just no bosses, managers, or strike breakers ðŸ™‚
