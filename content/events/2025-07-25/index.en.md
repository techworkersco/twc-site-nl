Join Tech Workers Coalition in the first organizing skills workshop of the summer! You'll be learning about and ✨ practicing ✨ structured organizing conversations.

Organizing conversations are a core skill for every tech worker, whether you want to form a union at your shop, or building community power against an incoming data center. 

Come attend this two-hour workshop where you'll learn the parts of an organizing conversation, practice these conversations in small groups, and get to know other tech workers who are also learning alongside.
