Do you worry you might get laid off? Hereâ€™s what you can do about it collectively - an online info session for Meta workers
{{< /lead >}}

Join an online info session hosted by the Tech Workers Coalition, where you will learn about steps you can take *right now* as a collective to try and prevent the layoffs and protect your jobs.

Learn how you and your coworkers can build stronger solidarity and organize for future collective actions to achieve your goals. 

There will be time during the session to ask questions.

The session is open to all Meta workers in the Netherlands except bosses and leadership. 

Ask your coworkers at Meta for the session link or [join Tech Workers Coalition](/en/join).
