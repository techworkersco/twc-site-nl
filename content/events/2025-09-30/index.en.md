People use generative AI for everything nowadays, whether at work, in education, or for personal advice. But how does this technology affect the working class at an individual and societal level?

From workers managed by opaque algorithms to the threat of mass automation, you often don’t see the human cost. And as AI has become increasingly integrated into people's lives, big tech companies have been pushing for deregulation, to crush competition, and to manage the technology with minimal transparency to maximize control and profits.

Join for a session with Will Denton from the Tech Workers Coalition, and Dwayne Monroe (marxist and veteran-IT worker) to discuss the other side of AI and how (if at all) you can use the technology to your advantage.
