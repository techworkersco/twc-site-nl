For this book club, bring along an short description of a workplace where workers are (wholly or partially) in control. Some possible discussion points:

* What form of control do workers have at this workplace?
* How did the workers come to have this sort of control? Is it new or was it there from the start?
* Anything you take from this example that other workers can learn from?

All welcome, just drop by if you're interested in the topic :)
