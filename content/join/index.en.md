**No managers rule:** You can only join the Tech Workers Coalition if you're currently _**not**_ in a role where you have hiring, firing, promotion, or demotion power over other workers. This is to make it easier for tech workers to speak and act freely within the coalition, without fear of on-the-job reprisal. 

Please make sure to fill in relevant sites/links below that help us to enforce this rule.
