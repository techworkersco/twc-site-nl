## Yes, you can join 

Do you work in the tech industry? Or are you doing any sort of tech work? Then you can join the Tech Workers Coalition! Yet there are a couple of exceptions, listed in what follows.

## Sorry not right now 

If, and for as long as, one or more of the following applies to you, you won't be able to join as a member:

- You work in a role that involves the **management, disciplining, or surveillance of workers**. For example, you work as a people manager, HR member, or team leader.
- You work in a role that involves or facilitates the **surveillance, arrest, imprisonment, or killing of people**. For example, you work with the police, prison system, military, or in the weapons industry.
- You want to join wholly or partially for **business purposes**. For example, you want access to members to promote your product, or to do user testing.
- You want to **study or interview** tech workers in your role as a researcher or journalist.

As soon as these criteria no long apply to you, you're welcome to submit a join request again.

Thanks for understanding! If you have any questions about the joining principles, [reach out via email](mailto:hey@techwerkers.nl).
