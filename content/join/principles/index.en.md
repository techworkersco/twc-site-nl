Tech Workers Coalition reserves the right to reject join requests from people who:

- work in a role that involves the management, disciplining, or surveillance of workers. For example, who work as a boss, people manager, HR member, or team leader.
- work in a role that involves or facilitates the surveillance, arrest, imprisonment, or killing of workers. For example, who work with the police, in the prison system, military, or weapons industry.
- want to join wholly or in part for business purposes, for example to promote a product or do user testing.
- want to study or interview tech workers in their role as a researcher or journalist.

Thanks for understanding! If you have any questions about these eligibility principles, [get in touch](mailto:hey@techwerkers.nl).
