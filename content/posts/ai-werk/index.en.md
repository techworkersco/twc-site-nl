Is generative 'AI' going to take your job? If you'd follow the hype, you'd almost think so. But it's not that simple, tech worker Roza Kuiper explains in a new article for *Jacobin*.

There's a huge gap between AI promises to deliver, and what it actually delivers. This tech is unlikely to take your job anytime soon.

Yet, that doesn't mean everything's fine. As Kuiper writes:

> The fact that a technology now exists that claims to be able to replace workers (even though it can't) gives companies an excuse to put pressure on people's working conditions.

Whether it works or not, bosses and managers will try to use the cover of AI as an excuse to convert full-time jobs into precarious gig work. That means that as workers, you must stay alert.
