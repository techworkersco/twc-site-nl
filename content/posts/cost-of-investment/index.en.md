This is an opinion piece from a Tech Worker. The information in this post was gathered through an
individual asking individuals in upper management about the subject matter.

# Why investment in the first place?

There are many ways to grow a business - some more sustainable than others, some are more of a gamble.

In short, a tech startup needs someone to do the work. That person needs to live too (in this current
economic system at least). So generally speaking there is a choice fairly early on in a business
about how to start it and get it running. Put very shortly (but not limited to):

- Do it for free
  e.g. finish a 40 hour week, keep working on your start up in your free time.
- Fund it yourself
  e.g. drain your savings/retirement
- Borrow money
  e.g. from the bank, parents, whomever
- Get investment
  e.g. "I will buy part of your company, with the hopes that one day it will be worth a lot"

This particular post is about that last part - "growth" through investment.

Put even shortly: "How can I make this thing a reality, whilst still continuing to exist?" is
generally answered with "Slave labour" or "Money".

But when a business is first being kicked off, they often don't have clients, they often aren't
making any money at all (unless you're really lucky). So this cycle is going to repeat for a while,
especially when the company is not pulling in revenue to cover the costs.

# The cycle continues...

So the business has started, someone is doing the work, and ideally that someone is being paid so
they are able to exist. This implies that the bank account is draining over time. It is common for business
to not break even in the first year(s), so this can go on for a while - in Twitters case, it was 15+
years.

So, in those years, people still need to get paid. Where does that money come from? It could be loans
(and it often is), or it could be investments (which it also often is).

The difference between a loan and investment is subtle but important. Generally speaking:

- A loan is purely for gaining money now, with the ideal being that more money will show up in the
  future which can be used to pay the loan off. A bank, lending institution, etc will give a company
  money, but expects that to be paid back within a certain amount of time otherwise interest accrues.
  Interest exists for two reasons:
  a) some people see it as payment for the "service" of lending money
  b) because if the loan can't be paid back and the company goes bankrupt, the money doesn't return.
     e.g. interest is used to make profit to offset the risk of the loan
- An investment is generally when money is given to a company, but as a trade for a portion of
  the company. Generally speaking, investments are higher risk for the investor (the person handing
  over the money), because if the company dies, they effectively own a portion of nothing.
  The company itself has the risk that they may sell too much of their company, at which point they
  loes control over the decision making.

So now a company has either got a loan, taken investment, and they have money in their "runway".
From here, the runway - and any money made by the business - is used to pay peoples salaries, and
to buy anything the company needs for operations and/or to fund further growth (e.g. marketing, etc).

So investment and loans may seem like legitimate "tools" to get a company running. Surely that's all
safe and sensibly done right?

# Right? Surely it's all sensible...

Gambling is regulated in many countries. Often more so than investments.

In the US stock market, there is an index fund call the S&P 500. In short, when someone purchases
a S&P 500 stock, they are purchasing part of the top 500 performing companies of the US stock market
all at once. This is generally seen by many as being a "low risk" investment because it doesn't rely
on the success of one company, but the success of many. The S&P has generally increased in value by
5-9% year over year for the last 30 years (all lows and highs combined).

But no, you're are an investor, and you have money to burn. Not all investors are built the same.
Some investors have expendable wealth and just like throwing money at things and watching them grow
out of intent for "helping others". Other investors see the S&P 500, and think "I can do better than"
5-9%. Although the vast majority of investment firms do worse than the general market [ref], the fact
is that there are some that make extreme amounts of money by being at the right place at the right
time - e.g. they took "The right risk".

Investors however need to pay their own bills (granted, mostly filled with the more extreme things
not used by a commoner), so they have a Portfolios of investment - e.g. they spread their risk by
investing in multiple things at once.
