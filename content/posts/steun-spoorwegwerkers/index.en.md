Today, workers at the *Nederlandse spoorwegen* (NS, Dutch railways) are going on strike. Why? They demand better pay and better working conditions---just like working people everywhere deserve!

Tech workers express their solidarity with the railway workers' workplace action. 

To gain:

* fair pay
* better support for heavy work 
* equal working conditions in equal circumstances
* prio-days at home 
* a 'dirty work' arrangement (for working with dirty materials or in conditions of stench)

They railway workers say:

> Workers have negotiated for months, but the NS [= employer] is unwilling to meet our demands on several crucial points (...). Going on strike is the only way in which workers can still exert pressure on the employer. Of course, strikes can be inconvenient for travellers. But travellers and workers share a joint interest in preventing and reversing deterioration of public transport.
