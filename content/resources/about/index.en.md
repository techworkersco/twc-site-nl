Tech Werkers is a community of tech workers that are based in The Netherlands. Tech Werkers is a local chapter of the [Tech Workers Coalition](https://techworkerscoalition.org/). All Tech Werkers are volunteers, and Tech Werkers is not a registered union.

## Who is a Tech Worker?

You and your colleageus no doubt. Tech workers can be software engineers, designers, product managers, ICT support, contact center workers, janitors, administrative staff, the list goes on. If you feel like you work directly with tech, or for a tech company, then you're likely a tech worker.

No matter what you job title is, what's more important is the changes you want to see in the tech industry.

## The Mission 

Tech Werkers equips tech workers in the Netherlands with education, training, and community support, so they can organize their workplace, in order to take back worker power in the Netherlands.

### What the mission really means

There are 3 main areas of action:

1. Education & Training
2. Organising support
3. Communiuty building

**Education & Training**

You cannot be expected to be an expert of everything. But you need support when things change. You need to know your rights if you are able to handle change, and also if you want to take action to help you and your colleagues. Although Tech Werkers are not lawyers, we have all worked for companies where changes are made without the oversight of those that work there. Tech Werkers collates, and shares information about your rights, and what they mean to you.

In the future, we would love to host sessions, possibly even training and workshops to all that want to be informed.

**Organising support**

Like many other countries in Europe, there is a legal __requirement__ for companies with 50 or more employees to have a Works Council - which is a group of employees that oversee changes in the company. Do you know who is in your Works Council? Does your company have more than 50 people, but they don't have a Works Council yet? This is one of many areas where Tech Werkers wants to help you to organise for the benefit of you and your colleageues.

**Community building**

You should not be working alone for the betterment of you and your colleagues. You deserve a supportive community of fellow tech workers who have organizing experience, and have your shared values top of mind. Whether it ls in the office, supporting the struggle for Palestinian liberation, or resisting exploitation in the Tech Industry (AI, surveillance, etc), all of these require you and a supportive community to help make change and win.
