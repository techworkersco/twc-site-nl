# I18n

Accessibility is important. Reading things in your own language is also important.

## Default locales

The fallback locale is `en`. Apart from that, landing on techwerkers.nl should redirect to techwerkers.nl/en/. Otherwise there is no special treatment of the `en` locale.

## Translation keys

`_i18n/` contains all the things you should need for translation keys. In
general, it is better to use a translation key than it is to switch between languages.

❌ `<h1>Something</h1>`

✅ `<h1>{{ t 'something' }}</h1>`

✅ `<h1>{{ translate 'something' }}</h1>`

👆 The above assumes a key of `something` exists in locale file in `_i18n/`.

## Links

Use `namespace` frontmatter attribute on pages, and the `translate_link` or `tl` tag in the `href`.

❌ `<a href="/something">Something</a>`

✅ `<a href="{% tl something %}">Something</a>`

✅ `<a href="{% translate_link something %}">Something</a>`
